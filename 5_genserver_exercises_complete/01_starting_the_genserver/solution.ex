# Extra information #
#####################

# 1. When you execute code under the API section, this code is executed as the caller process.
#      Elixir devs will often split this into the callback sections (thats what the GenServer)
#      module abstracts for you, and the API section is the "interface".

# 2. There are still some issues with our code. E.g. we do not know whether the answer from our
#      GenServer is associated with our request. In order to make it more secure, we could pass a
#      ref with our request, which is used to identify our response. Though this is out of scope
#      for this assignment

# 3. The send and receive applications in this exercise are ONLY for educational purposes. In the
#      next exercise, we'll replace this code. Please never write code like this for production apps.

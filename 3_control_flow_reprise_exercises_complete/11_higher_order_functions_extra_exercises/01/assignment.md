# Assignment

## Task

Write a function `Grades.remove_na(grades)` where `grades` is
an array containing

* Numbers between `0` and `20`, representing grades.
* `:na`, indicating the student did not take the exam.

`remove_na(grades)` should remove all occurrences of `:na`,
leaving only actual grades.

Make sure to rely on Elixir's standard library's `filter`,
not your own version.

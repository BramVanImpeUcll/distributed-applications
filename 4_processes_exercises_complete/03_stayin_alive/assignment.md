# Assignment

In the previous exercise, we made a magnificent
concurrent printer process: send it a string
and it will magically appear on the screen.

However, it's got a rather limiting flaw:
it's single use. If we send the printer
process a second message, nothing happens.
It appears that the printer process
simply ends after having received
and printed its message. Other messages
will never be retrieved for the message queue,
destined to remain ignored until the end of time.
Or until the application terminates, whichever comes first.

So, how do we make the printer process a bit more
persistent? After having received a message,
it should simply wait for another message,
and then another, and so on. In other words,
we need an infinite loop:

```elixir
while true do
  receive do
    message -> IO.puts(message)
  end
end
```

Remember that Elixir does not have looping constructs, fortunately, recursion comes to save the day!

An infinite loop is created by simply having the function call itself.

```elixir
def infinite_loop() do
    infinite_loop()
end
```

## Task 1

Take your solution from the previous exercise (`print`)
and update it as follows:

* You spawned only one `print` process: make sure to keep it that way.
* You sent only one message: change this so that multiple message are sent to the `print` process.

Run it. Only the first message should be printed.

## Task 2

Now update the `print` function so that the process remains alive and does not simply die after having printed one single message.
Do this by having `print` call itself at the end of its body, thereby creating an infinite loop. Now check that *all* messages are indeed printed.

# Assignment

Now that you know how to link processes, let's do this in practice.

First write a simple module that lets you link a process to another one. Then spawn 4 of these processes and link them to each other.

```text
A -> B -> C -> D -
^                 |
|-----------------
```

Then crash any one of them, then check whether any one of them is still alive.

_Note: your `iex` shell should not crash!_

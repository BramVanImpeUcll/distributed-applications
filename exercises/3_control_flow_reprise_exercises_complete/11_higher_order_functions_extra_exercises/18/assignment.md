# Assignment

Write the function `Store.total_cost(prices, basket)`
that given

* A map `prices` that maps items to prices and
* A list of items `basket`,

computes how much the items in `basket` are worth.
In other words, look up the price of each
item in `basket` and return the sum.

Solve the problem without descending to recursion;
rely on functions residing in the `Enum` module instead.

# Tutorial

Assigning values to variables in Elixir is called *binding*. Initializing a variable with a value *binds* that value to the variable:

```elixir
age = 42
```

Since Elixir is a dynamic language, it is not necessary to provide a type.

## Expressions

Binding a variable is an Elixir expression. Every expression in Elixir returns a result. In this case, the result is the value being bound to the variable.

## Naming Convention

Variable names in Elixir consist of lowercase ASCII letters, digits and underscores.

# Assignment

We are making some changes to the dangerous work environment and placing all the explosives near the workers so they don't have to walk that far. Now when something goes `:boom`, the whole building explodes, all workers have to be restarted.

Verify this by giving 2 workers work and sending `:boom` to a random worker. The work should stop decreasing, because they all have been restarted.

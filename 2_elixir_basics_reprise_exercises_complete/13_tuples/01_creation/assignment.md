# Assignment

To represent data, a programming language provides you with primitive values. In the case of Elixir, these are

* Integers
* Floating point numbers
* Atoms
* Functions

These are the "bricks". Now you need the "cement" to group them together.
OO languages such as C#, C++ and Java feature classes for this purpose.
Elixir has different, somewhat simpler (but also more limited) constructs.

One of these is the tuple. You can compare it to an array:
it can contain an arbitrary number of elements
which you can access efficiently.

`{ 1, 2, 3 }` is a tuple of three long, containing the elements `1`, `2` and `3`.
You can put anything you want in a tuple, including other tuples.
The elements don't need to have matching types.

Tuple related functionality resides in its own module, unsurprisingly
named `Tuple`. Feel free to take a look at the [documentation](https://hexdocs.pm/elixir/Tuple.html) to get
an idea of what is readily available.

Note that because Elixir is a purely [functional
language](../../../reading-materials/functional-programming.md), you are not allowed to modify tuples.
Instead, you are supposed to create new tuples.
For example, the `Tuple.delete` function removes an element from a tuple,
but it does so by returning a new tuple with the specified element missing:

```elixir
iex(1)> x = {:a, :b, :c, :d, :e}
{:a, :b, :c, :d, :e}

iex(2)> y = Tuple.delete_at(x, 2)
{:a, :b, :d, :e}

iex(3)> x
{:a, :b, :c, :d, :e}

iex(4)> y
{:a, :b, :d, :e}
```

## Usage

There are two distinct ways to use tuples.

On the one hand, you can use them as array-like containers.
However, given their statelessness nature, this might be
somewhat inefficient. Lists are probably a superior alternative.
These will be discussed in a later series of exercises.

On the other hand, tuples can also act as C#/Java/C++ objects
in that they group related data together. For example,

```C#
public class Position2D
{
    public int X { get; }
    public int Y { get; }
}
```

In Elixir, we could simply use a tuple `{x, y}` to group
the coordinates into a single value.

The downside of this approach is that as tuples grow large,
it becomes more difficult to remember where in the tuple each
piece of data belongs. In such cases, naming the different
fields will become necessary. Maps provide this functionality;
they will be discussed later.

In summary, whether you need tuples, lists or maps depends
on the context. As we progress, we'll try to make clear
which one is more apt for the situation at hand.

## Task

Write a function `Math.quotrem(x, y)` that returns a tuple containing

* the quotient (integer division) of `x` and `y`.
* the remainder (modulo) of the division of `x` by `y`.

Remember that `/` is a floating-point division. Search on how to perform integer division and module operations.
